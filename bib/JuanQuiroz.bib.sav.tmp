  abstract    = {This paper presents two approaches to obtain the dynamical equations of mobile manipulators using dual quaternion algebra. The first one is based on a general recursive Newton-Euler formulation and uses twists and wrenches, which are propagated through high-level algebraic operations and works for any type of joints and arbitrary parameterizations. The second approach is based on Gauss's Principle of Least Constraint (GPLC) and includes arbitrary equality constraints. In addition to showing the connections of GPLC with Gibbs-Appell and Kane's equations, we use it to model a nonholonomic mobile manipulator. Our current formulations are more general than their counterparts in the state of the art, although GPLC is more computationally expensive, and simulation results show that they are as accurate as the classic recursive Newton-Euler algorithm.</p>},

  abstract    = {This paper presents some improvements to the robot kinematic control strategy based on linear program-ming, as well as its application to a nonholonomic mobile manipulator. In addition to being computationally efficient, this approach enables the inclusion of inequality and equal-ity constraints in the system control inputs and has formal guarantee of stability. We first propose a new positive defi-nite function of the error variation to avoid joint movements when the robot end-effector stabilizes at a point differ-ent from the desired one. In addition, the nonholonomic constraint of the mobile base is imposed as an equality con-straint, and inequality constraints are defined to avoid both violation of joint limits and collisions between the mobile base and obstacles in the plane. Last, a performance com-parison between the linear programming strategy and an approach based on the pseudoinverse of the whole-body Jacobian matrix is presented. Experimental results show that the controller based on linear programming has low compu-tational cost, and the robot is able to control its end-effector without colliding with obstacles in the plane and without violating its joints limits. However, it tends to generate more abrupt control signals than the continuous controller based on the pseudoinverse of the whole-body Jacobian matrix.},

  abstract    = {This paper presents the implementation and performance comparison of two whole-body kinematic control strategies for a robot composed of one manipulator with five degrees of freedom (DOF) serially coupled to a nonholonomic mobile base. The control strategy is based on a cascade scheme composed of an outer loop that takes into account all DOF and an inner loop that explicitly deals with the nonholonomic constraints of the mobile base. The comparison is performed between two techniques applied at the outer loop to deal with the whole-body motion, namely a traditional approach that uses the pseudoinverse of the robot Jacobian matrix and the parsimonious control recently introduced by Gonçalves et al. [1]. Experiments on a real robot show that the parsimonious approach uses fewer actuators than the traditional approach at the expense of more abrupt control signals.},

   abstract = {This work uses vector field inequalities (VFIs) to prevent robot self-collisions and collisions with the workspace. We extend the VFIs to second order kinematics (SOVFIs) and, differently from previous approaches, the method is suitable for both velocity and torque-actuated robots. Furthermore, we present a formal proof of collision avoidance using SOVFIs. We propose a new distance function and its corresponding Jacobian in order to generate a VFIs to limit the angle between two Plücker lines. This new VFI is used to prevent both undesired end-effector orientations and violation of joints limits. In addition, we propose a new Jacobian related with the support polygon of a humanoid robot. This is used to maximize the support polygon area of the robot, and potentially increasing the robot's reachability and the robot safety in terms of its balance. We use the proposed Jacobians and the VFIs framework to enable whole-body control with multi-contacts using a full humanoid robot in simulation. The Euler-Lagrange model, which is used in conjunction with the SOVFIs for torque-actuated robots, is derived by means of the Gauss's Principle of Least Constraint using dual quaternion algebra. The use of dual quaternion algebra allows a more compact and unified representation for the twists and wrenches. The proposed method is evaluated in a realistic simulation on a 27-DOF full humanoid robot and on three real platforms: a 9-DOF humanoid robot, a 8-DOF bimanual manipulator, and a 16-DOF nonholonomic bimanual manipulator. Results show that all constraints are respected while the robot performs a manipulation task},
